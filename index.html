      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am a Texas native but moved to Portland in 2008 to attend Pacific Northwest College of Art. I currently hold a BFA in Intermediate Art with a focus in Animation and Painting. I have worked as an Art Department Intern on IFC's <em>Portlandia</em> where I created the design for <a href="https://youtu.be/A4nKY1QfWvg">Bart Ska-mpson</a>. I also worked on the final season of Hulu's <em>Shrill</em> creating graphics and at Bent Image Labs for an ad campaign for <a href="https://bentimagelab.com/crea-campaign/"><em>CREA</em></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>I decided to join Epicodus because I've wanted to change my career field for the past few years and find a lot of fulfillment in creating web pages and apps. I recently attended Portland Community College and took multiple classes in Data Analytics and Python Development, and hope to further my education and portfolio with projects that incorporate Machine Learning!</p>
